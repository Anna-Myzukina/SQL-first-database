## Learning Outcomes:
- What is a database?

      A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically 
      in a computer system.
- What are relational databases?

      A structured collection of data that follows the relational model.
- How are relational databases different from XML?

      XML is a tag based language (for want of a better term) for defining a hierarchical schema on a record by record basis         within a flat file. A relational database is an ecosystem based on the relational model of data created by Ted Codd and         consists of a language (SQL) with multiple components (DDL, DML, etc.), a set of operations (relational algebra), and a         management system. XML is used as the storage format basis for some NoSQL systems but in itself is not a replacement for       a relational database.

- What is SQL?

      Structured Query Language. The language used by RDBMSs.
- What is SQL used for?

      A SQL command used to access/use the database or the data within that database via the SQL language.
- How do you get all the records from a table in SQL?
      
      Select (SQL) The SQL SELECT statement returns a result set of records from one or more tables. A SELECT statement               retrieves zero or more rows from one or more database tables or database views. In most applications, SELECT is the most       commonly used data query language (DQL) command.
- How do you insert a record in SQL?
 
      The INSERT INTO statement is used to add new data to a database. The INSERT INTO statement adds a new record to a table.       INSERT INTO can contain values for some or all of its columns. INSERT INTO can be combined with a SELECT to insert              records.
